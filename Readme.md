# Lab 8.5 – Jenkins & Robot Framework

Hi, I’m Narathaip 👋  
This repository is created for Lab 8.5 in the Configuration Management course.  
It contains Jenkins pipeline setup and Robot Framework test automation.

## Structure

- `Jenkinsfile` – CI/CD pipeline definition using built-in Jenkins agent  
- `tests/Lab8.robot` – Robot Framework test case for demonstration

## Purpose

This repo is used to demonstrate:
- Jenkins Freestyle project setup
- Executing Robot Framework tests via pipeline
- Artifact archiving and result reporting

Let’s automate things the Narathaip way 🚀
